# High-School
A large conglomeration of most of the coding work that I did in high school.
Most of this work was done in the bluej IDE.
Also note that a lot of these projects aren'y documented very well, however
the title of each folder should be a good indication of what it is.
Most fun projects include:
  -Pathfinding
  -Pong
  -ReflexGame
  -Snake (1 & 2)
